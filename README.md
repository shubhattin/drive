### A _Simple_ Full Stack Drive Application

**Tech Stack Used**

- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - Sveltekit as Backend as well as Frontend using ([Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))
- **[tRPC](https://trpc.io/)** - Typesafe API for auth and Drive API
- **_[Deta](https://deta.space/developers)_** - A Free Hosting service to host and deploy our app. Also provides inbuilt support for databases and File Storage.

This Repository was using **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** as Backend and _[GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks/)_ for Drive API, till [this commit](https://github.com/shubhattin/drive/tree/a4a41919d92f0d614d4773efa6551f8653373714).

I had also _built_ the same site using **Nextjs** and **React** for frontend, [here](https://github.com/shubhattin/drive-react).
