### A _Simple_ Full Stack Drive Application

**Tech Stack Used**

- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** - Backend ([Python](https://www.python.org/)), also _[GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks/)_ for Drive API
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - Frontend ([Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))
- **_[Deta](https://www.deta.sh/)_** - A Free Hosting service to host and deploy our app. Also provides inbuilt support for databases and File Storage.

I had also _built_ the same site using **Nextjs** and **React** for frontend, [here](https://github.com/shubhattin/drive-react).
